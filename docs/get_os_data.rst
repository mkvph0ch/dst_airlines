get_os_data.py
--------------

This Python code performs the following functions:

Imports the necessary libraries: requests for making HTTP requests, time for getting the current time, and csv for writing to CSV files.
Gets the current time as an integer using time.time() function.
Initializes the root_url variable with the base URL of the OpenSky Network API and the all_states_url variable with the endpoint for retrieving all states.
Opens a CSV file named output.csv with write mode and creates a CSV writer object called writer.
Writes the header row to the CSV file using writer.writerow() function with a list of column names.
Sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenSky Network API endpoint with the URL constructed by concatenating root_url and all_states_url, along with a dictionary of query parameters (in this case, the current time) using the requests.get() function. 
The response is returned as a JSON object and stored in the r1 variable.
Extracts the 'states' key from the JSON object and stores the corresponding value (a list of lists) in the states variable.
If states is not None, writes each row of data to the CSV file using writer.writerow() function, where each row corresponds to an aircraft and contains various attributes such as icao24 code, callsign, origin_country.

Explanation
-----------
The code gets the current time as an integer, initializes the 'root_url' and 'all_states_url' variables with the base URL of the OpenSky Network API and the endpoint for retrieving all states, respectively. 
It then opens a CSV file with write mode and writes the header row to the CSV file. Next, it sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenSky Network API endpoint with the URL constructed using the 'root_url' and 'all_states_url' variables, along with a dictionary of query parameters (in this case, the current time) using the 'requests.get()' function. 
The response is returned as a JSON object, and the code extracts the 'states' key from the JSON object and stores the corresponding value in the states variable. If 'states' is not None, the code writes each row of data (corresponding to an aircraft and its attributes) to the CSV file using 'writer.writerow()' function.

The code can be run by executing the script in a Python environment or from the command line.
