I am using docker to install monfodb

To do so you need:

- docker installed
- create your own or copy given docker-compose.yml file

To run the container with mongodb:
	cd [directory where you've put docker-compose.yml]
	docker-compose up -d 
	[sudo] docker exec -it my_mongo bash


If you get an error that the port is busy:

	sudo lsof -i :27017
	sudo kill [PID]
and try again


*** You need mongodb container running to be able to connect to it from python code ***

-------------------------------------------------------------
Additional:
Once in mongo shell:

> show dbs
> use air_traffic_system
> show collections
> db.flights.findOne()

.. etc


--------------------------------------------------------------

If you run mongodb.py after launcing your mongodb as described, 
you should get database and collections created and populated with data
